# Football-Match-Predictions
This repository contains of two R files, that work with same data. Both contain the data of every match in 7 Bundesliga Seasons (2014/15 - 2020/21). The goal of both projects is to use the data to predict a certain match event and use the predictions for a betting strategy on the sports betting market. The amount of money we win/lose determines how good our prediction model is. Our first project predicts the match outcomes (Home Win, Draw, Away Win) and our second wether there will be more or less than 2.5 goals in the game. Means that both are classification problems, whereas the first one is a multiclass classification and the second is a binary classification.
